# Rust Exercises ðŸ¦€

This is the main entry point to Rust exercises that I attempt...  not attempt, finish spectacularly! This our mainly exercises that I find in *The Rust Programming Language* and *Learn Rust in a Month of Lunches*.

All in the effort to become as good as programming in Rust as I am in JavaScript - or better (better is an option!).
